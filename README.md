# CIS410 Project

### Project Scope
Keep in mind that you have a limited amount of time to complete the implementations (about 6 weeks for each). Therefore, plan the scope of your project wisely. Your project doesn’t have to include all the functionalities of a commercial web application. To keep your project manageable and doable, limit your application to about 6 functionalities, 8 pages, and 10 tables.

### Project Proposal
A project proposal (limit 5 pages) that provides the following information should be submitted on or before September 2:
- [x]  __Description__ - An overall description of the application that outlines its purpose, scope and target users.
- [x]  __Functionality__ – an itemized list (accompanied by a brief description) of the different functionalities that the application will offer.
- [x]  __Business Rules__ – a preliminary list of the rules that will govern your application.
- [x]  __Assumptions__ – assumptions (if any) that you have made about who will use your application and how they will use it.
- [x]  __Web Pages__ – a preliminary list of web pages. For each page, a brief description of its purpose and a written or graphic representation of its layout and contents. The proposed flow among the pages should also be included.
- [x]  __Validation__ – a preliminary list of the validation checks that will be performed on input data.
- [x]  __Database Schema__ – a preliminary list of normalized tables that will be required to support your application. For each table, its fields (name, data type and description) should be provided. Primary and foreign keys should also be clearly identified.
- [x]  __Model Sites__: A list of two to four existing sites on the Web that you plan to use as models for your
application.
- [x]  __Database Details__: a name for your database, and a username and password (simple and weak). _Not posted on GitHub_

### Project Implementations
After I approve the proposal, you will implement it twice; first using PHP (due on or before October 16) and then with ASP .Net (due on or before December 11). An updated proposal that includes any changes recommended by me or made by you (with my approval) during development will also be due on October 16. Note: Your implementations should reflect the database schema and functionalities that were approved by me. I will not accept any unapproved deviations/modifications from the proposal. Instructions on how to submit the projects will be provided separately.

### Project Grading Criteria
Your project proposal will be graded for its professional presentation and completeness. The implementations will be judged on the following:
- Functionality – dynamic and interactive pages that incorporate database searches and correct back-end database updates (additions, edits and deletes); secure pages (login/logout); state management (≈ 67%).
- Design – general site appearance, clear and logical navigation capability, appropriate choice of controls and images, page titles, consistency in the use of fonts, colors, style and layout, spelling and grammar, intuitive and easy to use interface (≈ 8%).
- Business Rules and Validation – adherence to the proposed business rules (e.g., should not be able to register for more than 18 credit hours); use of appropriate validation checks (e.g., required fields, correct data types, range checks) to ensure an error-free user experience (10%).
- Database – Minimum of five tables that are normalized; primary keys are defined; referential integrity is set (8%).
- Completeness - to what extent and how well the proposed functionalities are incorporated; to what extent the project has a professional “look and feel” and is ready for deployment (≈ 7%).

__Note__: You will have the option of “walking” me through your project (strongly recommended) or letting me grade your projects on my own. Instructions on setting-up appointments for the “walk-through” will be provided closer to the project due dates.
